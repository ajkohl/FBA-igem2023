# FBA-igem2023

After trying the traditional cobrapy solver, I ran into many errors with inconsistent values being generated in knockout analysis and many confounding results from the same analysis being run multiple times. I was recommended by Zach to attempt using the gurobi solver instead. Integrating the gurobi solver into my environment and doing the backend work in linux terminal allowed me to edit elements in the cobrapy library to implement gurobi solver into the cobrapy FBA utilities. This yielded much more consistent results doing analyses but upon attempting gene knockout analysis on these models, even the relevent genes identified in the model to be related to the p coumaric to daidzein path did not change flux in the target enzymes when knocked out. Many different troubleshooting attempts, edits, and approaches led to the conclusion that dynamic FBA and testing the flux of different reactions by the wet lab team would be the only way to acquire the necessary data to complete the incomplete baseline model, which ended up being the problem. Running this analysis on different FBA models yielded results yet this model seemed not to be sufficient. As to not expend wet lab resources, this was dropped as a general FBA tool and work was shifted to wiki and building machine learning models for IHP project components.
